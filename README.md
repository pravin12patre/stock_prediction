2. **Twitter API**: Get keys from [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/)

Add your API keys to the `data_fetcher.py` file:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.news_api_key = "your_news_api_key_here"
    self.twitter_api_key = "your_twitter_api_key_here"
```

### Model Training
- Models are automatically trained when you first enable predictions
- Training uses the last 2 years of data by default
- Models are cached for faster subsequent predictions
